   <h1><i>about nazriya</i></h1>
   <p1>Nazriya Nazim (born 20 December 1994)[1] is an Indian actress, producer and former television presenter who works predominantly in Malayalam films in addition to Tamil and Telugu films. She has won O
    ne Filmfare Award South, Two Kerala State Film Awards, and One Tamil Nadu State Film Award respectively.
    She started her career as an anchor on Malayalam television channel Asianet before pursuing a career as an actress. She made her debut as a child artist with Palunku (2006) and then as a lead actress in the 2013 Malayalam film Maad Dad. She has gone on to star in successful films such as Neram (2013), Raja Rani (2013), Ohm Shanthi Oshaana (2014), and Bangalore Days (2014).
    Following her marriage to actor Fahadh Faasil, 
    she took a break from acting.[2] She made a comeback in 2018 with Anjali Menon's movie Koode.
    Nazriya was born to Nazimuddeen and Begum Beena. She has a brother, Naveen Nazim.
    Her family lived in Al Ain, UAE, before moving to Thiruvananthapuram.
   She studied at Our Own English High School, Al Ain, UAE and at Christ Nagar School, Thiruvananthapuram and Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Trivandrum.[citation needed] In 2013, she joined Mar Ivanios College, Thiruvananthapuram,[7] but reportedly left the college, owing to her tight shooting schedules.[8]
Film career:
    Nazriya started her career as an anchor in a Muslim oriented television quiz show named Punyamaasathiloode in 2005 on Kairali TV, following up with various other anchoring roles.[9]
    She then started her acting career in 2006 as a child artist in the Malayalam film Palunku (2006), directed by Blessy, in which she played the daughter of Mammootty's character.[5] She went on to become an anchor on Asianet's popular music reality television show Munch Star Singer.[5] The Mohanlal-starrer Oru Naal Varum (2010) was her next venture, in which she played Dhanya, the daughter of Sreenivasan's character.[citation needed] She was cast in an album titled Yuvvh by Sony Music Entertainment, alongside Nivin Pauly which became very popular among the youth.[5]
    Nazriya finally landed in her first female lead role in the Malayalam film Maad Dad (2013). She was associated with the team of Yuvvh—director Alphonse Putharen and actor Nivin Pauly— again for the romantic comedy thriller film Neram—which was simultaneously made in Tamil and Malayalam. The movie became a big success, and the lead pair was appreciated by both critics and audiences alike. The scene in which Nivin proposes to Nazriya acquired cult status among cinegoers.[10][11] She received Vijay Award in the category of Best Debut Actress for her acting in Neram.[citation needed] She was then seen in Raja Rani, as an IT professional called Keerthana.[12] Gautaman Bhaskaran from Hindustan Times wrote: "the one person who caught my attention was Nazriya Nazim, who as Arya's lover Keerthana, is absolutely gorgeous with a face that is so expressive that we do not need her to speak".[13] Her next release was Naiyaandi, in which she played a dentist.[14]
    In 2014, she was first seen in Salalah Mobiles, which flopped despite having a strong star cast, including Dulquer Salmaan.[15] She has completed filming for Thirumanam Enum Nikkah in Tamil,[16] in which she acts as a Tamil Iyengar girl.[17] She then did Ohm Shanthi Oshaana in Malayalam, sharing screen with Nivin Pauly. The film was a big hit, and became a blockbuster, running 50 days in almost all theatres.[18]
    Her next films were Bangalore Days and Samsaaram Aarogyathinu Haanikaram in Malayalam, Thirumanam Ennum Nikkah and Vaayai Moodi Pesavum[19] in Tamil. Nazriya was signed to star in Nee Nalla Varuvada in October 2013.[20] However, in March 2014, Kajal Aggarwal was signed on and replaced Nazriya. She won the best actress in the 45th Kerala State Film Awards.
    Nazriya made a comeback with the Prithviraj-starrer, Anjali Menon film, Koode, after taking a break from films following her marriage to Fahadh Faasil. In 2020, she acted in the film Trance along with her husband after an year break.[21] In 2022, she made her Telugu debut with the film Ante Sundaraniki alongside Nani.</p1>
